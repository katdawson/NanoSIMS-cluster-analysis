# NanoSIMS-cluster-analysis
R-scripts used to process NanoSIMS data from SIP experiments

These are the collection of scripts used in RStudio (v.0.99.451) with R (v.3.2.1) to analyze NanoSIMS data associated with triple isotope SIP experiments. R packages required for these scripts include: cluster, clusterSim, clusterCrit, and ggplot2.

These scripts and the associated data is further described in Dawson, K.S., Scheller, S., and Orphan, V.J. (In Prep)  Stable isotope phenotyping via FISH-NanoSIMS reveals metabolic niche differentiation of environmental microbes
